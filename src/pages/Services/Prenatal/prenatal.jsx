        Taking care of pregnant moms means taking care of the whole family. The
        journey during preconception, pregnancy, labor and delivery and the
        postpartum period can affect the health of the entire family.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        In today’s healthcare, pregnancy is so medicalized that mom’s don’t
        trust their bodies to do what God intended. They are led to believe that
        their provider knows better than the mom about what’s going on in her
        own body.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        This view of pregnancy leaves moms with stress, anxiety, exhaustion and
        other challenges during pregnancy instead of feeling empowered and
        supported.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        At Stateline Family Chiropractic, we strive to provide moms with
        adjustments (obviously), support and empowerment that they so need and
        deserve!

        Chiropractic care during pregnancy and postpartum periods reduces
        tension, boosts energy, can help baby achieve ideal positioning and even
        help with an easier delivery and potentially decrease chances of
        Post-Partum Depression and Post-Partum Anxiety.
