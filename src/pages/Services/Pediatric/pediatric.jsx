        While kids are designed to be healthy, strong and resilient, right now
        for many families, that isn’t the case. Currently over 40% of kids have
        a chronic health condition such as autism, ADHD, asthma or epilepsy. The
        path to these chronic conditions begins as a series of acute, early
        childhood illnesses that traditional medicine cannot get a handle on.
        Things like colic, constipation, recurrent ear infections, allergies,
        sensory issues and developmental delays don’t just “disappear”. They
        don’t “grow out” of them, the kids just “grow into” these chronic
        challenges.
