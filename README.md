# Stateline Family Chiropractic

## About

This was a complete refresh and migration of the webpage and host-migration from WIX to Netlify. I took this site as a challenge to start fresh with what content and the first-look at what services Stateline has to offer, and to expand what I know about websites and hosting. Wix having a price increase was just the motivation I needed! 


I first learned about Netlify with the UNCC bootcamp, and my first impressions were great so I wanted to learn more. Speaking of changes, Google selling their domain business recently to Squarespace left me looking for a new registrar, so after some research I went with Namecheap for the new registrar. 


Moving the domains was a straight forward process, and DNS was, I think, a great thing to work with first hand too. Albeit, navigation of DNS, the name servers Netlify provided for use with the registr, Netlify not supporting DNSSEC was not expected, but I think, probably okay in this case. Setting up Namecheap with the configurations was really easy too. The biggest factor was time for the changes to propogate, but I knew this going into the change that changes take time.

This was a lot of fun, working with my wife, Dr. Katie, to get her business website up and be a little creative was a blast. I think this took me about 10 hours to do.
